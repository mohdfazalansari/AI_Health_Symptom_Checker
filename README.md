This repository contains the PowerPoint presentation of my project:
"AI-Powered Health Symptom Checker", developed as part of my learning journey with Edunet Foundation and IBM SkillsBuild.

ðŸ“„ About the Project
1)The project demonstrates how to use IBM Watsonx.ai and the Granite foundation model to create an AI assistant that:
2)Understands symptoms described in natural language
3)Provides educational health guidance (non-diagnostic)
4)Suggests urgency levels, home remedies, and when to consult a doctor
5)Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi)

ðŸ§©Tech Stack
IBM Watsonx.ai â€“ Granite Foundation Model for NLP
IBM Cloud Functions â€“ Serverless backend
Node.js / Python â€“ Backend logic
REST APIs â€“ Communication between frontend and AI model
IBM Cloud Object Storage â€“ Prompt templates & static files
